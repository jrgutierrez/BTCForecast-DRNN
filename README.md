# Bitcoin Prediction

This is a Machine Learning project, which goal is to predict the next hour Bitcoin price.

This is a 100% Python Notebook project.

In the Data folder, you can find three notebooks, which corresponds to Data Extraction (Bitcoin and Gold) and Calculation of Financial Indicators.

In the EDA folder, you can see the Exploratory Data Analysis Notebook.

And finally, in the Machine Learning folder, you can find the three Machine Learning models I used to try to aproach this problem.

Doubts, bugs and suggestions are well received.

You can explore the LSTM Neural Network we used here: [![Open All Collab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/18hgeN5MrKFvMUwFdortw8UwyZYYNqfGl?usp=sharing)
